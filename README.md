# libmds
Library for misc. data structures
I'll rename it to libmds when it's ready

## Features:
- Written in pure C
- Has data structures:
	- vector
	- llist
	- string
- Allocates lots of stuff on heap, so is 2x slower than C++ STL :-(
- But is quite a lot more memory-efficient!

## Compiling
### Prerequisites:
- gcc/clang
- GNU make

To build static and dynamic libraries with tests:
```linux
$ make
```
